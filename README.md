## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS

## My workflow
### 📁 Project Setup

- Tailwind CSS is configured using an `input.css` file as entry point.
- Compiled using Tailwind CLI to generate `output.css`.
- Simple project structure, with semantic HTML and clear separation of styles and markup.

### 🧱 Structure and Layout

- Built with a responsive **CSS Grid** layout.
- Semantic HTML tags used for accessibility and readability.
- Tailwind utility classes (`grid-cols`, `gap`, `rounded`, `text-`, etc.) used throughout.

### 🎨 Styling

Custom HSL-based CSS variables:

    --color-Red: hsl(0, 78%, 62%);
    --color-Cyan: hsl(180, 62%, 55%);
    --color-Orange: hsl(34, 97%, 64%);
    --color-Blue: hsl(212, 86%, 64%);
    --color-Grey-500: hsl(234, 12%, 34%);
    --color-Grey-400: hsl(212, 6%, 44%);
    --color-White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

Font used:

    --font-Poppins: 'Poppins', sans-serif, system-ui;

### 🚀 Deployment

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure components in a card layout with CSS Grid in Tailwind.

- Include hover animations or transitions on cards.
- Modularize layout for integration into component-based frameworks like React/Vue.
